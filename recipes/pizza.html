            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li><br>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li><br>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li><br>
                <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li><br>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><br>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li><br>
                <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li><br>
                <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li><br>
                <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li><br>
                <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li><br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>

            </ol>

            <h3>Recipe Tips:</h3>
            <p>You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour makes a superior crust. If you have a pizza stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</p>
