            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a
                deliciously cheesy filling. </p>
            <p> A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a
                blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy
                green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li><br>
                <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until
                    browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano,
                    and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
                    noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10
                    minutes. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190
                    degrees C).</li><br>
                <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in
                    a large bowl until combined.</li><br>
                <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to
                    to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li><br>
                <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese.
                    Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover
                    the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li><br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden
                    brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <h3>Recipe Tips:</h3>
            <p>For a more traditional filling, substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. You can also add layers of veggies, such as spinach and mushrooms, when layering your lasagna.</p>
